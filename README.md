# Plug.bot #

A collection of tools and extended features for Plug.dj, a free live DJing service.  Inspired by TechGuard's Autowoot.  All code is written in Javascript, mostly based off of the Plug.dj API which can be seen here:  http://blog.plug.dj/p/api-documentation.html


### Features List ###

+ Auto-woot  :  Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
+ Auto-queueing  :  Automatically re-append yourself to the DJ Waitlist whenever you play a song
+ User list *NEW!  :  Lists all of the users currently in the room, and highlights them white if they're undecided, green if they're wooting, and red if they're mehing
+ Button UI  :  Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button!
+ Hide video *NEW!  :  Lets you cover up the video player in case what's playing is NSFW or for any other reason you choose to hide it.  Resets every time a new song is played
+ Open-source code  :  All code of plugbot.js and plugbot.css are available in this repo, no cost, no secrecy
