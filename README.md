# Plug.bot #

A collection of tools and extended features for Plug.dj, a free live DJing service.  Inspired by TechGuard's Autowoot.  All code is written in Javascript, mostly based off of the Plug.dj API which can be seen here:  http://blog.plug.dj/p/api-documentation.html


### Features List ###

+ Auto-woot ("Autohwheat")  :  Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
+ Auto-queueing ("Autoqueue")  :  Automatically re-append yourself to the DJ Waitlist whenever you play a song
+ Woot/meh counters ("Ratios")  :  Lets you view who's Wooting, who's Mehing, and both lists are collapsable in case you don't care for one of them!
+ Button UI  :  Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button!
+ Hide video ("Hide/show video") NEW!  :  Lets you cover up the video player in case what's playing is NSFW or for any other reason you choose to hide it.  Resets every time a new song is played
+ Open-source code  :  All code of plugbot.js and plugbot.css are available in this repo, no cost, no secrecy


### Installation ###

Literally so easy.

1.  Create a new bookmark in your web browser.  In Firefox and Chrome, just click the star icon in the top right.  If you really need help with this, Google is your friend.  Or Yahoo.  Or Bing (god forbid.)
2.  Title the bookmark whatever you desire;  this is irrelevent to Plug.bot.  I named it Plugbot.
3.  In the field titled, "Location" "URL" "Website" "Link" "Place" or WHATEVER it may be, add the following: <a href="http://pastebin.com/B3pZbnyD">http://pastebin.com/B3pZbnyD</a>
4.  Save and run the bookmark while you have your Plug.dj tab open.  If it was successful, the GUI will become visible beneath the video player.

### Version History ###

0.1a:
	1. Not organised at all.  It functioned, but made no sense.  Concluded on 24-6-2012

0.2.0a:
	1. 24-6-2012:  Version released.  This is going to, hopefully, introduce similar functionality while providing structural strides.  Will be as OO as possible.
