# Plug.bot #

A collection of extensions to the growing online DJing website, <a href="plug.dj">plug.dj</a>.  The source code is written in JavaScript utilising the Plug.dj API anywhere possible.  Easily embeddable as a bookmark in your favourite browser.  Initially inspired by TechGuard's AutoWoot script from back in April '12.  



### Features List ###

+ Auto-woot  :  Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
+ Auto-queue/auto-DJ  :  Automatically re-append yourself to the DJ Waitlist once you've been moved back to the crowd
+ User list  :  A dynamic list of every user in the room, colour-coded based on their current vote.  Green = Woot, Red = Meh, White = No vote  Special usergroups are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat
+ Button UI  :  Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button.  Red = Off, Green = On
+ Hide video  :  Allows you to hide videos from your view
+ Custom username FX  :  Now allows you to change some user's names in the chatbox to a different colour
