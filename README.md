# Plug.bot #

A collection of tools and extended features for Plug.dj, a free live DJing service.  Inspired by TechGuard's Autowoot.  All code is written in Javascript, mostly based off of the Plug.dj API which can be seen here:  http://blog.plug.dj/p/api-documentation.html


### Features List ###

+ Auto-woot  :  Whenever the DJ is advanced, the Woot button is clicked.  Allows for AFK point farming.
+ Auto-queue [optional]  :  Whenever the user is finished playing their song, one more song is skipped, then they are re-added to the DJ Queue, or Wait List.
+ Sidebar  :  This sidebar allows you to view the current list of those who are "WOOT!" or "Meh" 'ing the current song.  I am still in the process of making this fully functional, so please be patient!
+ Bookmarklet  :  Easy portability.  Makes it so developers can update remotely, then users just have to click the bookmark again to update.
+ jQuery-powered GUI [in development]  :  A jQuery and CSS powered GUI menu which allows users to enable/disable features easily.
+ Open-source code  :  All code written for the Plug.bot script is available here on Github.  I may or may not end up extending it to multiple files.  We'll see where the development goes ;)


### Installation ###

Literally so easy.

1.  Create a new bookmark in your web browser.  In Firefox and Chrome, just click the star icon in the top right.  If you really need help with this, Google is your friend.  Or Yahoo.  Or Bing (god forbid.)
2.  Title the bookmark whatever you desire;  this is irrelevent to Plug.bot.  I named it Plugbot.
3.  In the field titled, "Location" "URL" "Website" "Link" "Place" or WHATEVER it may be, add the following: <a href="http://privatepaste.com/9ef6afeea1">http://privatepaste.com/9ef6afeea1</a>
4.  Save and run the bookmark while you have your Plug.dj tab open.  If it was successful, the GUI will become visible beneath the video player.

Try to keep the subject relevant, or else I won't see it and think it's related to Plug.bot.


### NOTICE ###

If you are wondering, as there's been lots of confusion -- yes, WOLVES from Dubstep Den has stolen code from me.  However, it's a very outdated version because he is apparently too much of an airhead to just clean out the stuff that says Plug.bot and just steal it like a man.  Regardless, if you see Xhila autowoot being advertised anywhere, just know that it was indeed code of mine.  Except I wrote it a month ago (again, failed theft.)
Unfortunately, I have no grounds to take legal action, so we just have to hope that Mr. Wolff goes back to making bad websites instead of stealing my 5-minute JS code.
